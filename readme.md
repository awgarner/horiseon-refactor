-This is a refactoring of code I recieved as a practice exercise for a hypothetical development project for a company called 'Horiseon'

-Visit the website here https://awgarner.github.io/horiseon-refactor/


- The goals were as follows:
    1. simplify css styling and classes to remove redundancy
    2. employ semantic HTML elements for A11y and cleaner HTML
    3. added alt descriptors for images
    4. added descriptive comments in CSS file
    5. Gave website descriptive title for enhanced SEO and A11y
